# ML1 - Basic course: S5

## Demystifying machine learning for medical data analysis

Past, present and future of ML applied to Medical Data Analysis. The field of ML is very broad; and an emphasis will be put on clarifying concepts and simplifying them for a general audience. Concepts include:

* A brief overview of the machine learning cycle
  * Data preparation
  * Splitting data into train, test and validation sets
  * Training a ML model
  * A taxonomy of ML models, including the most prominent families of ML models
  * Cross-validation and external validation
  * Bringing models to production \(model deployment\)
* Links between ML and conventional tools in statistics \(the past\)
* A selection of medical data analysis studies/articles applying ML \(the present\)
* End-to-end pipelines and the promises of ML; how the ML cycle will be embedded in medical data management centers \(the future\)

Based on this general introduction, participants will be encouraged to suggest at least one current task in their own field of research where ML could be applied.
