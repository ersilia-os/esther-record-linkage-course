# Welcome to Record Linkage!

## Towards an end-to-end record linkage pipeline using machine learning

The aim of this course is to explore the potential of Machine Learning \(ML\) techniques applied to Record Linkage \(RL\). We will start the course by providing a gentle introduction to ML. Then, in a series of more specialized sessions, we will revisit the classical steps of record linkage \(data processing/cleaning, blocking, comparison...\) and will try to understand how ML can be used to increase linkage quality, performance and level of automation.

The course will be structured in 2 introductory sessions and 4 hands-on sessions focused on synthetic datasets provided to participants.
